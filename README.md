# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Project

## 📌 **Project Overview**
This project implements a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system using LangChain's advanced tools and retrievers. The system intelligently retrieves and processes relevant information from multiple sources, enhancing response accuracy and contextual depth.

## 🚀 **Key Features**
- **Wikipedia Query Tool**: Extracts summarized knowledge from Wikipedia to provide quick factual responses.
- **LangSmith Documentation Retrieval**: Utilizes FAISS vector search to fetch and return relevant information from LangSmith documentation.
- **Arxiv Query Tool**: Retrieves research papers from Arxiv, offering academic insights on various topics.
- **Conversational Agent**: A GPT-3.5-turbo-based agent that dynamically interacts with users and provides well-informed answers.

## 🏗 **How It Works**
1. **Retrieval Mechanism**: The system fetches data from Wikipedia, Arxiv, and LangSmith documentation using API wrappers and a vector database.
2. **Vector Search with FAISS**: Embeds and indexes document data to perform similarity-based retrieval, ensuring precise responses.
3. **Tool-Based Querying**: Each tool is designed for specific knowledge domains, and the agent intelligently selects the appropriate one.
4. **Conversational Interaction**: The LLM-based agent processes user queries and retrieves the most relevant data for generating well-structured responses.

## 🎯 **Future Enhancements**
- Expanding retrieval sources, including Google Search API and custom datasets.
- Implementing hybrid retrieval (combining dense and sparse vector search) for improved accuracy.
- Deploying the solution as an API using FastAPI or Flask for seamless integration.
